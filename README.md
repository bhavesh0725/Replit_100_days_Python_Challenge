## Project 1: Print into the World

Welcome to my 100 Days of Python Challenge! This is Day 1, and I'm excited to share my progress with you.

### Project Description

In today's challenge, I wrote a simple Python program to print my full name and today's date. I also added some personal touches to express my commitment and feelings about the challenge.
